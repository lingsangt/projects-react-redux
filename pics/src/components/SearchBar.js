        Note the {this.onInputChange} has no extra parenthesis like this.onInputChange()

        If there were parenthesis, the function would be called everytime render was called.
        But without the parenthesis, this.InputChange is just passed in as a reference to 
        <input /> onChange.

        Other examples of event handlers are onClick and onSubmit.

        Note that we can't attach these event handlers to div elements because div elements can't 
        be clicked.
